askbot
------
This module sets up askbot as the primary URL for the host at / using apache's httpd server in conjunction with mod_wsgi.

Known Issues
-------
* You need stdlib and cprice-postgresql, neither of which are currently on the forge.
* There is no hiera integration, it's all in params.pp
* Only tested in Centos6 and Debian Wheezy
* The opininos file is kind of specific to a test instance I ran
